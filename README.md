# Random-Gospel

### This is my first project using Go. I wanted to create a utility to retrieve random sections of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

## Commands
- build: go build
- run: go run main.go
- test: go test -v ./...
- generate coverage: go test -v ./lib/ -coverprofile=lib/coverage.out
- view coverage as html: go tool cover -html=lib/coverage.out
